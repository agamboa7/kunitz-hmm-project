# Laboratory of Bioinformatics I Project

This repository contains materials for a project developed during the *Laboratory of Bioinformatics I* course at the University of Bologna. The main objective is to build a Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, starting from structural data and using it for functional annotation of protein sequences. The project involves retrieving data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), sequence analysis, and the application of HMMs to search databases such as SwissProt. 
*Please note that this project is still in progress and the content in this repository is subject to change.
