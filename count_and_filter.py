count_and_filter.py

This script prints the length of each (single-line) sequence in a FASTA file.
It then prompts the user to confirm whether they want to filter the sequences
by length (between 55-85). If the user types 'yes', an output file is generated
containing only the filtered sequences.

Usage:
    python count_and_filter.py <input_file.fasta>
